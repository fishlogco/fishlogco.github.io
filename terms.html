        <!-- 1. Agreement -->
        <h2 id="agreement">1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Fish Log mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
        <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Fish Log Co. ("Fish Log," "we," "us," or "our"). Please read them carefully.</p>

        <!-- 2. Eligibility -->
        <h2 id="eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use Fish Log. If you are between 13 and 17, a parent or guardian must agree to these Terms on your behalf. The Rewards Member program and quarterly rewards drawings are open only to legal residents of North Carolina who are 18 years of age or older.</p>

        <!-- 3. Accounts -->
        <h2 id="accounts">3. Accounts &amp; Registration</h2>
        <p>You may use Fish Log to submit harvest reports without creating an account. To access additional features such as the rewards program, community catch feed, and fishing history tracking, you must register as a Rewards Member by providing a valid email address.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing accurate and current information during registration.</li>
          <li>Maintaining the security of your account and email.</li>
          <li>All activities that occur under your account.</li>
          <li>Notifying us promptly of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We authenticate Rewards Members via passwordless magic link email. You must have access to the email address you registered with in order to sign in.</p>

        <!-- 4. Harvest Reporting -->
        <h2 id="reporting">4. Harvest Reporting</h2>
        <p><strong>You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your harvest reports.</strong> Fish Log provides a convenient tool to help you submit reports to the NC Division of Marine Fisheries, but we do not independently verify catch information, fish measurements, species identification, or regulatory compliance.</p>
        <p>Important disclaimers regarding harvest reporting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fish Log does not guarantee that your report was successfully received by NC DMF. Always verify using the confirmation number provided.</li>
          <li>Fish Log is not a substitute for knowing and following current NC fishing regulations. Always consult official sources at <a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/marine-fisheries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deq.nc.gov</a>.</li>
          <li>Submitting false or fraudulent harvest reports may violate North Carolina law.</li>
          <li>Reports submitted through Fish Log may be used by NC DMF for fisheries management and enforcement purposes.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>Winner selection:</strong> Winners are selected randomly from all eligible entries. Winners will be notified by email.</li>
          <li><strong>Disqualification:</strong> We reserve the right to disqualify entries we determine to be fraudulent, abusive, or submitted in bad faith.</li>
          <li><strong>Prizes:</strong> Prize details, quantities, and values are specified in the drawing configuration for each quarter and are subject to change.</li>
        </ul>
