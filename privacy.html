        <!-- 1. Introduction -->
        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Fish Log Co. ("Fish Log," "we," "us," or "our") operates the Fish Log mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App. By using Fish Log, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>
        <p>Fish Log helps North Carolina anglers log their catches, submit mandatory harvest reports to the NC Division of Marine Fisheries (NC DMF), participate in a community catch feed, and earn rewards through our quarterly rewards program.</p>

        <!-- 2. Information We Collect -->
        <h2 id="info-collect">2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <p>When you use Fish Log, you may voluntarily provide the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and zip code when you register as a Rewards Member.</li>
          <li><strong>Profile information:</strong> Profile photo and contact preferences (text/email confirmation opt-in).</li>
          <li><strong>Fishing license information:</strong> Whether you hold a license, WRC ID / Customer ID, license number, license type, and license dates.</li>
          <li><strong>Harvest report data:</strong> Species caught, quantities, fish length and weight, catch condition, tag numbers, release status, fishing method, bait type, hook type, harvest area (DMF area code), harvest date and time, and any additional notes.</li>
          <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Catch photos and profile photos that you choose to upload.</li>
          <li><strong>GPS coordinates:</strong> If you voluntarily enter location coordinates for a catch entry. We do not automatically collect your GPS location.</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback and support requests:</strong> Messages, bug reports, and feature requests you submit through the in-app feedback system, along with your email if you provide it for follow-up.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>When you use Fish Log, certain information is collected automatically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Device identifier:</strong> We generate a unique, random device identifier (UUID) the first time you open the App. This identifier is stored locally on your device and persists across app sessions and updates. It is used to associate your harvest reports with your device and to provide continuity of service.</li>
          <li><strong>Anonymous user record:</strong> When you first use the App, we create a record associated with your device identifier in our database. This allows you to submit harvest reports without creating an account. If you later register as a Rewards Member, your anonymous history may be linked to your new account.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform and device information:</strong> We collect your device platform (iOS or Android), operating system version, and app version. This information is included with feedback submissions and used to diagnose issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Advertisement interactions:</strong> We record aggregated (non-personal) impression counts and click counts for advertisements shown in the app. This data is not linked to individual user profiles, is not used for personalized ad targeting, and is not shared with advertisers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not automatically access your GPS location. The App includes a location library but does not request location permissions or track your position.</li>
          <li>We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs (such as Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, Facebook SDK, or AdMob).</li>
          <li>We do not collect contacts, calendar data, microphone input, or browsing history.</li>
          <li>We do not access your device's photo library, contacts, or camera without your explicit action (e.g., choosing to attach a photo to a catch).</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 3. How We Use Your Information -->
        <h2 id="how-use">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Harvest reporting:</strong> To submit your mandatory harvest reports to the NC Division of Marine Fisheries on your behalf.</li>
          <li><strong>Account management:</strong> To create and manage your Rewards Member account, authenticate your identity via magic link email, and maintain your profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Rewards program:</strong> To administer our quarterly rewards drawings, track your entries, and notify winners by email.</li>
          <li><strong>Community features:</strong> To display your catches in the community catch feed (Rewards Members only, with your first name and last initial visible to other users).</li>
          <li><strong>App improvement:</strong> To diagnose bugs, respond to feedback, and improve the App's functionality and user experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send harvest report confirmations via text or email if you opt in, and to respond to your support inquiries.</li>
          <li><strong>Offline functionality:</strong> To store pending reports locally when you lack an internet connection, and sync them when connectivity is restored.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 4. Information Sharing -->
        <h2 id="sharing">4. Information Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information. We share data with the following parties only as necessary to provide our services:</p>

        <h3>4.1 NC Division of Marine Fisheries (NC DMF)</h3>
        <p>When you submit a harvest report, the following data is transmitted to NC DMF via their official ArcGIS reporting endpoint: your name, zip code, fishing license status, WRC ID (if applicable), species and quantities caught, harvest area, fishing method, and contact preferences. This data is required by North Carolina's mandatory harvest reporting law. Photos and GPS coordinates you enter in the App are <strong>not</strong> transmitted to NC DMF.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Supabase</h3>
        <p>We use <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supabase</a> as our backend infrastructure provider for database hosting, user authentication, and file storage. Your data is stored in Supabase's cloud infrastructure. Supabase processes data on our behalf under a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) that complies with GDPR requirements, including Standard Contractual Clauses for international data transfers. Please refer to <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Zippopotam.us</h3>
        <p>When you enter or update your zip code in your profile, we use the <a href="https://www.zippopotam.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zippopotam.us</a> API to validate the zip code and retrieve associated city and state information. Only the zip code you enter is transmitted to this service. Results are cached locally on your device.</p>

        <h3>4.4 Other Users (Community Catch Feed)</h3>
        <p>If you are a Rewards Member, your catch data may be displayed in the community catch feed. Visible information includes your first name and last initial, species caught, fish counts, lengths, and any photos you uploaded. Anonymous users' reports are never displayed in the catch feed.</p>

        <h3>4.5 Law Enforcement &amp; Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</p>

        <!-- 5. Data Retention -->
        <h2 id="retention">5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Retained until you delete your account.</li>
          <li><strong>Harvest reports:</strong> Retained in our system until account deletion. Reports already submitted to NC DMF are retained by the government agency per their own policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Stored in our cloud storage until you delete your account.</li>
          <li><strong>Anonymous user records:</strong> Retained until the associated device identifier data is deleted upon request.</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback submissions:</strong> Retained for as long as necessary to resolve your issue and improve the App.</li>
          <li><strong>Local device data:</strong> Stored on your device until you clear the app's data or uninstall the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 6. Data Security -->
        <h2 id="security">6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.</li>
          <li>Authentication tokens are stored using your device's secure storage system (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android) when available, with an encrypted fallback.</li>
          <li>Our database uses row-level security policies to ensure users can only access their own data.</li>
          <li>Account deletion is performed as a server-side cascading transaction to ensure complete removal of all associated data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
