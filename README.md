# Fish Log Website

Static website for the Fish Log mobile app, providing the Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Support, and Account Deletion pages required by the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

### Quick Setup

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `fishlogco.github.io`
2. Push the contents of this `website/` folder to the repository:

```bash
cd website
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial website deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/fishlogco/fishlogco.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```

3. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy from the `main` branch
4. Your site will be live at: **https://fishlogco.github.io**

### Custom Domain (Later)

When you're ready to use a custom domain (e.g., `fishlog.app` or `fishlog.co`):

1. Add a `CNAME` file to this folder containing your domain name
2. In your domain registrar, add a CNAME record pointing to `fishlogco.github.io`
3. In the GitHub repository settings, enable "Enforce HTTPS"
4. Update the `WEBSITE_BASE_URL` constant in `src/screens/LegalDocumentScreen.tsx`

## Pages

| Page | File | URL | Purpose |
|------|------|-----|---------|
| Home | `index.html` | `/` | App landing page with features and download links |
| Privacy Policy | `privacy.html` | `/privacy.html` | Required by App Store and Play Store |
| Terms of Use | `terms.html` | `/terms.html` | Required by both stores |
| Support | `support.html` | `/support.html` | Contact info and FAQ |
| Delete Account | `delete-account.html` | `/delete-account.html` | Required by both stores (account deletion instructions) |

## App Store URLs

Use these URLs when submitting to the app stores:

- **Privacy Policy URL:** `https://fishlogco.github.io/privacy.html`
- **Terms of Use URL:** `https://fishlogco.github.io/terms.html`
- **Support URL:** `https://fishlogco.github.io/support.html`
- **Account Deletion URL:** `https://fishlogco.github.io/delete-account.html`

## Updating Content

All pages are plain HTML/CSS with no build step required. Edit the `.html` files directly, commit, and push. Changes deploy automatically.

The in-app legal content in `src/screens/LegalDocumentScreen.tsx` should be kept in sync with the website. The app shows a summary and links to the full hosted document via the "View Full ..." button.
